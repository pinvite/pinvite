## Firebase
We are hosting the website at Firebase, as it provides Firebase Authentication which can be integrated with Twitter login.

### Deploy to Firebase

- `npm install -g firebase-tools` //only for the first time to install Fireabase CLI
- `firebase login` //Your Google acct needs to be added to the pinvite Firebase project first. Talk to the project admin.
- also `git push origin master`

Will add CI for auto deploy later.

## Twitter application

Needed to provide Twitter login capabilities for users.
